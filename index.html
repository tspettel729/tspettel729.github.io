            <p>
                Hello, my name is Tristen Spettel, and I am a junior at Albion College, actively involved in several
                on-campus organizations, including the Men’s soccer team, Greek life, and percussion in the Albion
                Symphony Orchestra. I am part of Albion’s 3–2 Applied Physics: Engineering Program, through which I will
                earn degrees in physics and mechanical engineering, along with a minor in applied mathematics.
            </p>

            <p>
                Since Albion does not offer a mechanical engineering degree, the program partners with other schools,
                allowing students to complete their engineering studies after three years at Albion. I chose to pursue
                mechanical engineering because of my long-standing interest in how machines work and my enjoyment of
                building from a young age.
            </p>

            <p>
                During summer, winter, and spring breaks, I work as a Reliability Technician at HECO Inc. in their
                predictive service group. This role has strengthened my communication skills with customers, on-site
                workers, and management—an essential skill set for working as a contractor and collaborating with new
                teams daily.
            </p>
