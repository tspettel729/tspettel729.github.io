            Hello, my name is Tristen Spettel, and I am a Junior at Albion College, actively involved in several
            on-campus organizations, including the Men's soccer team, Greek life, and percussion in the Albion Symphony
            Orchestra. I am part of Albion's 3-2 Applied Physics: Engineering Program, through which I will earn degrees
            in physics and mechanical engineering, along with a minor in applied mathematics. Since Albion does not
            offer a mechanical engineering degree, the program partners with other schools, allowing students to
            complete their engineering studies after three years at Albion. I chose to pursue mechanical engineering
            because I have always been fascinated by how machines work and enjoyed building with Lego. During summer,
            winter, and spring breaks, I work as a Reliability Technician at HECO Inc. in their predictive service
            group. This role has strengthened my communication skills with customers, on-site workers, and management
            officials - an essential skill set for working as a contractor and collaborating with new people daily.
